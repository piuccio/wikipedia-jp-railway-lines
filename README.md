## List of Japanese railway lines extracted from Wikipedia

The list of railways is generated from Japanese Wikipedia, it's probably not very useful in itself, maybe you're looking for [open-data-jp-railway-lines](https://github.com/piuccio/open-data-jp-railway-lines).

The list of manual English names comes from [japan-train-data](https://github.com/adieuadieu/japan-train-data) which uses Google translate. The result accuracy is variable, so double check those.

## Contributing

The manual data is inside `./manual_english_names.csv`, you can send pull requests changing that file.

If you want to generate the data locally, run `npm start`, it'll override the manual file, so make sure to merge the changes.
